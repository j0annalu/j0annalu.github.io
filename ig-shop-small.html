          <p>Our main research goals are to see how users shop or discover businesses on Instagram. We are interested in how we could improve the Instagram shopping or business discovery experience. While our aim is to help business owners, our target audience are the average Instagram users. To gain more insight, we plan to use several methods of research such as surveys, interviews, and direct observation. We created two surveys: asking questions about the customers’ experiences involving shopping online and how do they find local or small businesses to support and asking business owners to gauge how they use Instagram to promote their business and what they want to see more from Instagram Shop. To further this research, we also interviewed select business owners to build upon their goals. We reached out to these business owners via Instagram. Next, we tested out the app’s features ourselves as well as directly observed users navigating through the app with a list of goals for them to accomplish (i.e. finding a local restaurant’s account, booking an appointment, etc). For social distancing purposes, we asked participants to screen record their phones. </p>

          <p>This project helped me grow as a designer through user research, creating graphics and prototyping with Figma, and communicating design choices. I was able to story-tell through personas and work closely with target users. Though this was a class project and unrelated to Instagram as a company, I enjoyed being empathetic with small business owners and everyday social media users.</p>
          <p>I would like to thank Professor Guo and Instructional Assistant Nhu Luong for their guidance through this project. I would also like to thank my teammates Nicolette Shin and Julia Chu for doing such good work in our collaboration as well as being so fun to work with! <i class="far fa-smile"></i></p>
