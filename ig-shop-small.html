          <p>For our HCI class, my team and I chose to explore finding ways to sustain businesses during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted businesses nationally; and small businesses have taken the biggest hit. As Instagram grows with its marketing potential, it has expanded its features to be used for online shopping. Thus, we decided to focus on Instagram, a multifaceted platform with over 1 billion users worldwide. </p>

          <h6 style="margin:0";>Explore Page Changes</h6>
          <p>We chose to iterate upon our explore page. In Prototypes A and B, we had an image of a featured store – in this case, The Plant Shop – which would catch user’s attention and provide users an entry point into Instagram Shop. One issue with this, however, was that it almost meshed too well with the other images within the explore page. The “Browse Small Businesses” text was not very discoverable, which posed an issue for how effective this design would be. To alleviate this, we opted to incorporate a similar ombre-effect graphic – similar to the banner-style post within the home page of Prototype A. With this, it would capture the user’s attention while still giving them the entry point of accessing Instagram Shop.</p>

          <h6 style="margin:0";>Explore Instagram Shop</h6>
          <p>Another improvement we made in our final prototype design was listening to our user's preference for our services and shops landing page in Prototype B. In Prototype B, we laid out the shop and services by incorporating a “For You” section with featured shops and services specific to the user, how many of their friends/accounts they follow went/shopped at those small businesses, as well as an option to easily view the shops and services they follow. In our final prototype, we moved the For You section up to be at the forefront of the landing pages, with an ombre button that allows users to view the shops and services they follow.</p>

          <p>This project encountered many bumps along the way due to our team's struggle to decide on the focus on the project such as which were our target users and which feature of Instagram to utilize. We brainstormed and prototyped on multiple features including a business messaging system that we ended up leaving out. I was able to make tough decisions through research and reasoning.</p>
          <p>I would like to thank Professor Guo and Instructional Assistant Nhu Luong for their guidance through this project. I would also like to thank my teammates for doing amazing work in our collaboration as well as being so fun to work with! <i class="far fa-smile"></i></p>
